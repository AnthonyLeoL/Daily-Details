# Daily-Details, a To Do List with a Purpose
<p> This web app is a to do list built with prioritizing and motivation at the heart of it. The philosphy of Daily-Details is to catorgize everything needed to be done in a day into one of four different levels of priority,
 <ol>
   <li>Must Do Today</li>
   <li>Should Do Today</li>
   <li>Would be Nice to do Today</li>
   <li>Do whenever</li>
  </ol>
The idea is to think about things you "Must Do Today" as non-negotiable necessities. The motivation here is simple, you must do all of your "Must Do"s. As a real world example, in a day you must eat. No two ways about it. There's no excuses of "Well, I'm really busy today, I'll just eat twice as much tomorrow instead." When you have to use the restroom, theres no "I'm tired today, I'll do it another time." No. you simply Must do it. Everything you must get done in a day needs to be thought of in the same way.</p>
