# Daily-Details, a To Do List with a Purpose
<p> This web app is a to do list built with prioritizing and motivation at the heart of it. The philosphy of Daily-Details is to catorgize everything needed to be done in a day into one of four different levels of priority,
 <ol>
   <li>Must Do Today</li>
   <li>Should Do Today</li>
   <li>Would be Nice to do Today</li>
   <li>Do whenever</li>
  </ol>
The idea is to think about things you "Must Do Today" as non-negotiable necessities. The motivation here is simple, you must do all of your "Must Do"s. As a real world example, in a day you must eat. No two ways about it. There's no excuses of "Well, I'm really busy today, I'll just eat twice as much tomorrow instead." When you have to use the restroom, theres no "I'm tired today, I'll do it another time." No. you simply Must do it. Everything you must get done in a day needs to be thought of in the same way.</p>

<p>Daily Details is my personal daily planner and motivational tool. The concept is to order your day in terms of importance, taking the decision making out of scheduling. By changing the most important parts of your day from a task that takes brain power and limited decision making into something that is done without thought, like eating, or washing your hands, you save brain power and motivation for more tasks. Using this tool I consistently went to the gym 5 days a week for 6 consecutive months. Interrupted only by quarantine. Additionally I used this to organize homework and assignments during my last two years of college. I continue to use this every morning to plan out my day. </p>
